0.08 2009-11-18

    - Calls to list() no longer perform lookups while iteration takes place.
      This is no longer necessary after updates to the FreshBooks API in
      August 2009.  This means that one call to list returns all of the data
      for the requested page, so multiple API calls are no longer necessary.
      Multiple API calls will still, of course, be necessary if fetching
      multiple pages.
