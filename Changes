Revision history for Perl module Net::FreshBooks::API

0.14 2010-10-07
    - Fixed missing package versions which broke distro 0.13

0.13 2010-10-07
    - Fixed a bug where OAuth URL would not always use correct account_name
      when being constructed
    - Added many new API params
    - Expanded documentation and shifted much off of API.pm and to the
      subclasses

0.12 2010-09-07
    - Fixed some documentation errors
    - Documented OAuth-specific methods
    - Overriding more of Net::OAuth::Simple in order to get examples working

0.11 2010-09-07
    - Move distro management to Dist::Zilla
    - Added OAuth support
    - Moved a lot of the documentation from API.pm to sub-modules

0.10 2009-11-23
    - Iterator's next() method now returns cloned objects
    - Added documentation for Invoice links() and list() functionality

0.09 2009-11-19
    - Added amount field to recurring items
    - Added documentation for the lines() method

0.08 2009-11-18
    - Added explicit documentation for most available methods
    - Calls to list() no longer perform lookups while iteration takes place.
      This is no longer necessary after updates to the FreshBooks API in
      August 2009.  This means that one call to list returns all of the data
      for the requested page, so multiple API calls are no longer necessary.
      Multiple API calls will still, of course, be necessary if fetching
      multiple pages.
