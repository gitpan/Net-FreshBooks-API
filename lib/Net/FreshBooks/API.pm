=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<http://www.freshbooks.com> is a website that lets you create, send and
manage invoices. This module is an OO abstraction of their API that lets you
work with Clients, Invoices etc as if they were standard Perl objects.

Repository: L<http://github.com/oalders/net-freshbooks-api/tree/master>

=head2 OAUTH

OAuth is the recommended method of authentication, but it can take a few days
for FreshBooks to approve your OAuth application. In the meantime, you can get
started right away by using an auth_token.

Once your application has been approved, your consumer_key will be your
FreshBooks account name and your consumer_key_secret will be provided to you
by FreshBooks in your account. If you need to generate an access_token and
access_token_secret, you can so so by running the oauth.pl script in the
/examples directory which is included with this distribution.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new API object using OAuth:

    my $fb = Net::FreshBooks::API->new(
        {   consumer_key        => $consumer_key,       # same as account_name
            consumer_secret     => $consumer_secret,
            access_token        => $access_token,
            access_token_secret => $access_token_secret,
        }
    );

Create a new API object the old (discouraged) way:

    # auth_token and account_name come from FreshBooks
    my $fb = Net::FreshBooks::API->new(
        {   auth_token   => $auth_token,
            account_name => $account_name,
        }
    );

=head2 client

Returns a L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Client> object.

=head2 estimate

Creates and returns a new L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Estimate> object.

=head2 invoice

Creates and returns a new L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Invoice> object.

=head2 language

Creates and returns a new L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Language> object.

=head2 payment

Creates and returns a new L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Payment> object.

=head2 recurring

Creates and returns a new L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Recurring> object.

=head2 ping

  my $bool = $fb->ping(  );

Ping the server with a trivial request to see if a connection can be made.
Returns true if the server is reachable and the authentication details are
valid.

=head2 service_url

  my $url = $fb->service_url(  );

Returns a L<URI> object that represents the service URL.

=head2 verbose

Setting verbose to a true value will allow you to inspect the XML which is
being sent to FreshBooks

=head2 ua

  my $ua = $fb->ua;

Return a LWP::UserAgent object to use when contacting the server.

=head2 delete_everything_from_this_test_account

    my $deletion_count
        = $fb->delete_everything_from_this_test_account();

Deletes all clients, invoices and payments from this account. This is
convenient when testing but potentially very dangerous. To prevent accidential
deletions this method has a very long name, and will croak if the account name
does not end with 'test'.

As a general rule it is best to put this at the B<start> of your test scripts
rather than at the end. This will let you inspect your account at the end of
the test script to see what is left behind.

=head1 OAUTH METHODS

=head2 OAUTH ACCESSOR/MUTATOR METHODS

The following OAuth methods are getter/setter methods, which can optionally also
be passed to new().  Required or optional is used in the context of OAuth
connections.  If you are not connecting via OAuth then you can safely ignore
these options.

=head3 account_name( $account_name )

Required. Account name is the account name of the user who wishes to connect
to your app.

For example, if "acmeinc" is attempting to connect to your "widgets" app:

    # acme usually logs in via https://acmeinc.freshbooks.com
    $fb->account_name( 'acmeinc' );

=head3 consumer_key( $consumer_key )

Required. The consumer key will be provided to you by FreshBooks, but it's
generally just the name of your account.

    # account name is "mycompany"
    # https://mycompany.freshbooks.com

    $fb->consumer_key( 'mycompany' );

(In the case where you are logging in to your own app, consumer_key and
account_name will have the same value.)

=head3 consumer_secret( $secret )

Required. The consumer_secret is provided to you by FreshBooks. You'll need to
log in to your account to access it.

=head3 access_token( $access_token )

Optional.  If you do not have an access_token, you'll need to acquire one
with your code and then set this parameter before you request restricted
URLs.

=head3 access_token_secret( $access_token_secret )

Optional. If you do not have an access_token_secret, you'll need to acquire
one with your code and then set this parameter before you request restricted
URLs.

=head3 account_name_ok

Returns true if $fb->account_name appears to be valid.

=head2 OAUTH ACCESSOR METHODS

=head2 oauth

Returns a L<Net::FreshBooks::API::OAuth> object. This is a subclass of
L<Net::OAuth::Simple> See L<Net::FreshBooks::API::OAuth> as well as the
scripts in the /examples folder of this distribution for use cases.

=head1 WARNING

This code is still under development - any and all patches most welcome.

The documentation is by no means complete. Feel free to look at the test files
for more examples of usage.

Up to this point, only clients, invoices and recurring items have been
implemented, but other functionality may be added as needed. If you need other
details, they should be very easy to add. Please get in touch.
