=head1 NAME

Net::FreshBooks::API::Client

=head1 VERSION

version 0.12

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $fb = Net::FreshBooks::API->new({ ... });
    my $client = $fb->client;

=head2 create

    # create a new client
    my $client = $fb->client->create(
        {   first_name   => 'Larry',
            last_name    => 'Wall',
            organization => 'Perl HQ',
            email        => 'larry@example.com',
        }
    );

Once you have a client object, you may set any of the mutable fields by
calling the appropriate method on the object:

    $client->first_name( 'Lawrence' );
    $client->last_name( 'Wahl' );

These changes will not be reflected in your FreshBooks account until you call
the update() method, which is described below.

=head2 update

    # take the client object created above
    # we can now make changes to the client and save them
    $client->organization('Perl Foundation');
    $client->update;

    # or more quickly
    $client->update( { organization => 'Perl Foundation', } );

=head2 get

    # fetch a client based on a FreshBooks client_id
    my $client = $fb->client->get({ client_id => $client_id });

=head2 delete

    # fetch a client and then delete it
    my $client = $fb->client->get({ client_id => $client_id });
    $client->delete;

=head2 list

Returns n L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Iterator> object. Currently,
all list() functionality defaults to 15 items per page.

    #list all active clients
    my $clients = $fb->client->list();

    print $clients->total . " active clients\n";
    print $clients->pages . " pages of results\n";

    while ( my $client = $clients->next ) {
        print join( "\t", $client->client_id, $client->first_name, $client->last_name ) . "\n";
    }

To override the default pagination:

    my $clients = $fb->client->list({ page => 2, per_page => 35 });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class gives you object to FreshBooks client information.
L<Net::FreshBooks::API> will construct this object for you.
