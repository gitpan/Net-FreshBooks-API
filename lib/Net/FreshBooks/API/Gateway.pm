=head1 NAME

Net::FreshBooks::API::Gateway - List gateways available in your FreshBooks account

=head1 VERSION

version 0.22

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $fb = Net::FreshBooks::API->new(...);
    my $gateways = $fb->gateway->get_all();

    # or
    my $autobill_gateways = $fb->gateway->get_all({ autobill_capable => 1 });

=head2 list

Returns an L<Net::FreshBooks::API::Iterator> object. Currently, all list()
functionality defaults to 15 items per page.

    # list all gateways
    my $gateways = $fb->gateway->list();

    print $gateways->total . " gateways\n";
    print $gateways->pages . " pages of results\n";

    while ( my $gateway = $gateways->next ) {
        print join( "\t", $gateway->name, $gateway->autobill_capable ) . "\n";
    }

=head2 get_all

Returns an ARRAYREF of all possible results, handling pagination for you.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns a list of payment gateways enabled in your FreshBooks account that can
process credit card transactions. You can optionally filter by
autobill_capable to return only gateways that support auto-bills. See
L<http://developers.freshbooks.com/docs/gateway/> for more info.

You should note that there is no "get" method for Gateways as the API does not
provide it.
