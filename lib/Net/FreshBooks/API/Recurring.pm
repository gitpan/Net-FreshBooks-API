Net::FreshBooks::API::Recurring - FreshBooks Recurring Items

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::FreshBooks::API;
    use Net::FreshBooks::API::InvoiceLine;
    use DateTime;
    
    # You will not access this module directly, but rather fetch an object via
    # its parent class, Net::FreshBooks::API
    
    # auth_token and account_name come from FreshBooks
    my $fb = Net::FreshBooks::API->new(
        {   auth_token   => $auth_token,
            account_name => $account_name,
        }
    );

    # create a new client
    my $client = $fb->client->create(
        {   first_name   => 'Larry',
            last_name    => 'Wall',
            organization => 'Perl HQ',
            email        => 'larry@example.com',
        }
    );
    
    # create a recurring item
    use Net::FreshBooks::API;
    
    my $line = Net::FreshBooks::API::InvoiceLine->new({
        name         => "Widget",
        description  => "Net::FreshBooks::API Widget",
        unit_cost    => '1.99',
        quantity     => 1,
        tax1_name    => "GST",
        tax1_percent => 5,
    });
    
    # use the client object from the previous example

    my $recurring_item = $fb->recurring->create({
        client_id   => $client->client_id,
        date        => DateTime->now->add( days => 2 )->ymd, # YYYY-MM-DD
        frequency   => 'monthly',
        lines       => [ $line ],
        notes       => 'Created by Net::FreshBooks::API',
    });
    
    $recurring_item->po_number( 999 );
    $recurring_item->update;
